                    <p> &nbsp A supercar is a car that combines speed, handling, unique design and represents the pinnacle of the automaker's art. 
                        Supercar is the car equivalent of a supermodel or a race horse. There are, off course, some basic criteria for measuring whether 
                        a car should be considered a supercar or not. Things to consider: design, acceleration, top speed, handling, power-to-weight ratio, 
                        style, rarity, price - all of these has to be super in a supercar.</p>

                &nbsp &nbsp Well, according to Wikipedia, a supercar – also called exotic car – is a loosely defined description of street-legal,
                high-performance sports cars. Since the 2000s or 2010s, the term hypercar has come into use for the highest performing supercars. 
                Supercars commonly serve as the flagship model within a vehicle manufacturer's line-up of sports cars and typically feature various 
                performance-related technology derived from motorsports.

                &nbsp &nbsp A more recent term for high-performance sportscars is "hypercar", which is sometimes used to describe the highest 
                performing supercars. As per supercars, there is no set definition for what constitutes a hypercar. An attempt to define these is 
                "a limited-production, top-of-the-line supercar with a price of around or more than US$1 million."
